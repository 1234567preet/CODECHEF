Q : FDGHLM:-
  In this question we are required to find the hcf and lcm of two number.
  We start by finding out the greater number out of the two, then making a copy of the two numbers as we want the original numbers at the end and we would be making    
  changes to the the original variables for calculating the hcf.
  For calulating the hcf : 
    we'll be using euclidean division to find the hcf.
    initailly let "a" be the variable containing the lesser number and "b" the variable containing the greater number
    loop until b is not diviisble by a:
      in the loop, store the value of a in a temp variable
      store the value of the remainder of division of b and a
      in  b store the value of temp(original value of in the bgining of the iteration)
     
    when we exit the loop, the value of a will give the hcf of a and b
    for calculating the lcm we can use the fact that for two numbers A & B, HCFxLCM = AxB 
    
    
    
   
   
Q: FINDMELI:
  In this question we have to find if a specific value exists in a given list of value
  For that we can either loop throught the list or us "in" keyword, both work the same way for the most part, unless u input the list as a set
  
 
 
 
 
Q: PRCHECK:
  In this question we have to find whether the given number is prime or not
  As the first step, we'll check if the given number is one or not, if 1 then the number is a composite number, else we'll move forward
  If the number was not equal to 1 then we'll run loop from 2 till the square root of the number, and if the number is divisible by any number in the range then
  it's a composite number, else a prime number
  
 
 
 
Q: REVMEE:
  In this question we will be given a list of number and asked to print it in  reverse order. We can take couple of approaches:
    Either take an index from the end of the list till the starting and print along
    or use the builtin python function "reversed()" to reverse the lsit and then print it.
    
    
    
    
Q: RNGEODD: 
  In this qestion we have to print the odd numbers in a given range.
  First of all we'll check whether the starting number of the range is odd or even , if even add one to it, else do nothing
  then run a loop staring from the initail value to end, while incrementing 2 and printing along
