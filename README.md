This Repository contains the codes, questions as well as the logics(for those peeps who don't want to just blindly copy the codes for grades) for all the CodeChef assignments till date.


There is a seperate folder for each assignment which further contain the codes and questions.

The logic.txt file in each folder contains my logics(someone may have better logics than me out there) for all the questions in the folder



If anyone has any doubts or wants to give a better approach to any question, feel free to fork the repo and create a pull req for that question.
